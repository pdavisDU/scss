    <h1>Same Color Same Suit</h1>
    <h2>a game of similarities</h2>
    <p>Same color same suit, a drinking game of similarity: 2-4 players</p>
    <h2>Dealing</h2>
     <p>Remove jokers from the deck. To deal the cards you shuffle and then dump all cards in the center of the table. (feel free to mix the cards around with your hands)</p>
      <h2>Basic Play</h2>
      <p>• To decide who goes first you can either choose to roll a
      die, and the player with the highest roll starts off and then you proceed
      through the game in a clockwise fashion. OR if no die is available you can
      draw cards before they are dealt and whoever draws the high card starts
      first.
      </p>
      <p>• Once the order is set, the first player draws 2 cards and
      plays the game by the drinking/scoring guidelines below. From here the
      game is self explanatory.
      </p>
      <p>• You will keep two piles of cards, a pile WITH similar cards(LIVE VIEW PILE) and your pile WITHOUT similar cards(FACE DOWN PILE). If the 2 cards you draw during your hand have no similarities at all that are listed below, those cards are put into your Face Down pile, this will be used at the end of the game to decide how long the WINNER and LOSER drink. If the cards DO have similarities then they will be in your LIVE VIEW PILE (face up) (make sure to keep these cards in a neat stack to keep the similarities paired)
      </p>  
      <p>• Cards WITH similarities are added to your LIVE VIEW PILE. The objective being to end up with the least amount of pairs in your scoring pile.
      </p>
      
    
      <h2>Scoring/drinking rules</h2> 
      <table>
        <tr>
      <th>Similarity</th>
      <th>Consequence</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>Everyone must shout "Name Of The Game!" and all drink 8 seconds</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Same Number (Excluding 7's & Ace's)</td>
          <td>Drink that number of seconds</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Double 7</td>
          <td>Drink for 14 seconds</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Double Aces</td>
          <td>Drink for 15 seconds</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Same Number Same Color</td>
          <td>Drink the number of the card + 3 seconds (Aces = 11)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
      
    <p>If you play a perfect hand (no cards at all that are similar) you chug your whole drink. A perfect hand means you don't end up having any cards with
      similarities, which means your scoring pile will be all non similar cards.
    </p>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>• At the end the person with the least amount of cards in the LIVE VIEW PILE(pile with similar cards) is the winner, person with most cards
      in the LIVE VIEW is the loser.
    </p> 
    <p>• The WINNER will drink the amount of cards in seconds(not just pairs, but total cards) that the LOSER has in his SCORING pile (pile with no similarities). The LOSER will drink the amount of cards in seconds that the WINNER has in the SCORING pile.
    </p>
     <h2>Tie Breaker Rules</h2> 
     <p>Deal out 5 pairs for each side. That means 20 total cards dealt out for a tie breaker match. If the match results in a tie again, do another tie breaker Winner drinks the amount of cards the loser has Loser drinks amount winner has
